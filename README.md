# Polarization-GameNet
Polarization GameNet is a benchmark dataset for modeling two-player zero-sum polarization games in social networks. Each data sample includes a synthetic social graph, node-level opinion states, and the ground truth Nash equilibrium strategies for both players, computed using a game-theoretic solver. The Nash equilibrium arises from a strategic interaction between two agentsâ€”one aiming to maximize network polarization and the other seeking to minimize it. This setting models adversarial and defensive interventions in public opinion, with broad relevance to research in algorithmic game theory, social influence modeling, and robust AI planning. Polarization GameNet enables tasks such as equilibrium strategy prediction, intervention policy learning, and robustness analysis under graph perturbations. We provide baseline solvers, evaluation metrics, and PyTorch-compatible loaders to support experimentation. The dataset and code are publicly available, and all instances are fully reproducible.
