# Polarization-GameNet
We introduce Polarization GameNet, a benchmark dataset for modeling strategic polarization game dynamics in social networks. Each instance represents a two-player non-zero-sum game in which one player aims to maximize and the other to minimize polarization over a network of agents with initial opinions. The dataset includes synthetic social networks, node-level opinion features, and ground truth Nash equilibrium strategies for both players. This setting models adversarial and defensive interventions in public opinion, with broad relevance to research in algorithmic game theory, social influence modeling, and robust AI planning. Polarization GameNet enables tasks such as equilibrium strategy prediction, intervention policy learning, and robustness analysis under graph perturbations. We provide baseline solvers, evaluation metrics, and PyTorch-compatible loaders to support experimentation. The dataset and code are publicly available, and all instances are fully reproducible.
